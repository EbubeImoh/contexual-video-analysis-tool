# Understanding Context from Videos

## Overview

The "Understanding Context from Videos" project is designed to analyze video content by extracting and processing both visual and auditory elements to generate a detailed contextual summary. The project combines various computer vision and audio processing techniques to achieve this goal. It focuses on:

- **Extracting frames and audio** from videos.
- **Detecting objects** within each frame.
- **Recognizing faces** and **detecting emotions** in frames.
- **Recognizing actions** from a sequence of frames.
- **Transcribing audio** to text for additional context.
- **Combining all information** to provide a comprehensive contextual analysis.

- `src/main.py` - The entry point of the project, which executes the video analysis workflow.
- `utils/audio_processing.py` - Contains functions for extracting audio from videos and transcribing it.
- `utils/video_processing.py` - Includes functions for extracting frames, detecting objects, recognizing faces, detecting emotions, and recognizing actions.
- `video/` - Directory for storing input video files.
- `audio/` - Directory for storing extracted audio files.
- `yolov5n.pt`, `yolov8n.pt` - Pretrained YOLO models used for object detection.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Module Import Errors
Initially, there were issues with importing modules from the `utils` package due to incorrect paths and missing `__init__.py` files. Resolving these required setting the correct project paths and ensuring the package structure was correctly recognized by Python.

### 2. Video Path Issues
The project faced errors related to video file paths, causing issues when attempting to read or process video files. Ensuring that paths were correctly specified and relative to the project root was critical.

### 3. Audio Extraction Failures
Encountered issues where no audio track was found in the video, likely due to discrepancies between the video format and audio extraction methods. This required troubleshooting and validating the video files.

### 4. YOLO Model Loading Errors
Errors occurred when attempting to load YOLO models from local paths. This was due to incorrect file paths and missing `hubconf.py` files. Reconfiguring the model paths and ensuring the correct versions of YOLO models were used resolved these issues.

### 5. Integration of Multiple Processing Steps
Combining various processing steps (e.g., object detection, emotion recognition, audio transcription) into a cohesive workflow presented integration challenges. Ensuring compatibility between different libraries and handling data transfer between steps required meticulous planning and debugging.

## Progress So Far

- Successfully implemented video frame extraction and audio extraction functionality.
- Achieved object detection and emotion recognition in frames using YOLO models.
- Integrated audio transcription to extract textual information from video audio tracks.
- Developed a basic framework for combining all information into a contextual summary.
- Addressed initial module import and path-related issues.

## Current Challenges

- **Improving Accuracy**: Enhancing the accuracy of object detection and emotion recognition to handle a wider range of video content and scenarios.
- **Handling Diverse Video Formats**: Ensuring compatibility with various video formats and handling cases where audio tracks might be missing.
- **Model Optimization**: Optimizing the YOLO models for better performance and reducing inference time.

## Future Improvements

- **Embedding Models**: Incorporating embedding models to better refine context understanding and improve accuracy in recognizing objects, faces, and emotions.
- **Advanced Contextual Analysis**: Implementing more sophisticated methods for combining and analyzing different types of data (visual, auditory) to provide deeper insights.
- **Scalability**: Enhancing the system to handle large-scale video datasets and integrating it into a more extensive application or platform.
- **User Interface**: Developing a user-friendly interface to allow for easier interaction with the analysis results and better visualization of contextual summaries.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the project.
- **MoviePy**: For video and audio processing.
- **OpenCV**: For frame extraction and basic image processing.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: For object detection in frames.
- **PyTorch**: For loading YOLO models and performing inference.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For transcribing audio to text.
